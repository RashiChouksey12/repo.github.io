        <p>The day a student goes to school for the first time is called first day at school. My first day at school is
            a memorable day for me. It is a red-letter day for me.<br> When my parents declared the news of my
            schooling,<br><br> I became very much excited and started leaping and dancing in great joy. Then the
            expected day came. I went to every member of our family and received blessings from all. I was in a very
            happy and cheerful mood.<br><br> I went to school for the first time when I was only seven years old. My
            father took me to school for the first time. I was little nervous at the beginning. I remember it well. I
            was then a little boy. I was very interested in going to school with riding rickshaw accompanied by my
            father. First I met with Headmaster at school. My heart beat fast. But this smiling face and gentle words
            put me at ease. He asked me my name. I answered politely. The headmaster was very pleased with my response.
            When I was sent to class. My class teacher took me to the classroom and introduced to my classmates. I met
            with the teachers and students who behaved well with me. My classmates were very much friendly and soon they
            accepted me as one of their bosom friend. They received me very cordially and made friendship with me,
            within a short time. The school broke up at 2 pm. My father again came and took me home. I left the school
            with a cheerful mind. That day was very remarkable in my life.
            Traffic jam is a situation in where vehicles cannot move freely and traffic comes to a standstill. It occurs
            almost all the district towns where a lot of vehicles play everyday. Especially it occurs near bus stand,
            railway crossing, turn of a road, at the junction of various roads or near a market. It occurs mainly in the
            morning and afternoon on working days when everyday body tries to attend office in short time or returns
            home as early as possible. The indiscriminate playing of vehicles like rickshaws, bus, scroters etc and
            haphazard parking of vehicles and small shops in the footpaths are the main reason of traffic jam. Traffic
            jam causes untold sufferings to people. Students cannot reach schools in time. It kills our time and lessons
            our working hours. It causes great sufferings to the ambulance carrying dying patients and the fire brigade
            vehicles. The increasing of traffic jam hampers our economy. So well spacious roads should be constructed.
            One-way movement of vehicles should be introduced. The driver should be trained in order to cope with the
            other developed nations. After doing all these things we can hope to have a good traffic system for our easy
            and comfortable movement.
